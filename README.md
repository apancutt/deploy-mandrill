## Concepts

### Layout

A layout represents the overall appearance of the e-mail template. It contains the HTML header and footer that wrap the main content (the _template_).

This tool allows for multiple layouts allowing different messages to have different appearances. You could also make use of multiple layouts to apply a temporary seasonal theme the to e-mails (e.g. create an `xmas` layout with a Christmas-y background, etc.)

Each layout is stored in the `./layouts/` folder. A single layout file exists for all locales. Any necessary localisation should be implemented using _partials_.

Use the `<!--TEMPLATE-->` placeholder to mark where the template should be embedded.

### Templates

Each message has a corresponding _template_. This is the content specific for the message being sent.

Each template is stored in the `./templates/` folder. A template file exist for each supported locale.

The template is published to Mandill using the naming convention `<template>-<locale>` (e.g. `welcome-en-us`).

### Partials

Layouts and templates often share snippets of HTML, such as welcoming or sign-off messaging. To avoid repetition, you should embed a _partial_.

Like templates, each partial is stored as a subfolder in the `./partials/` folder, and contains various `.htm` files; one for each supported locale.

Each partial is stored in the `partials/` folder. A partial file exist for each supported locale.

Use the `<!--PARTIAL:name-->` placeholder where you'd like a partial to be embedded, replacing `name` with the name of the partial.

## Configuration

The global configuration file should be located at `./config.json`. This contains some default settings which are inherited by the templates.

Individual options can be overridden by templates. Create a config file in `./templates/<template>/config.json` containing the options you'd like to override.

The configuration file is in JSON format. At the top level is the locale for which the options are applied to.

### Example
```
# Global config at ./config.json (inherited by all templates)
{
  "en-us": {
    "layout": "default",
    "subject": null,
    "from": {
      "name": "My Company",
      "email": "support@mycompany.com"
    }
  }
}

# Template-specific config at ./templates/welcome/config.json
{
  "en-us": {
    "subject": "Welcome Aboard!"
  }
}

# Effective config passed to the "welcome-en-us" template
{
  "en-us": {
    "layout": "default",
    "subject": "Welcome Aboard!",
    "from": {
      "name": "My Company",
      "email": "support@mycompany.com"
    }
  }
}
```
